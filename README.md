# Python-Chat-Bot
This Python script is a KBC-inspired quiz game with 10 multiple-choice questions tied to increasing cash prizes. Players can use lifelines—50-50, audience poll, and flip—once per game. The game ends on a wrong answer or if the user quits. It uses OOP, lists, and dictionaries to manage questions and gameplay.
